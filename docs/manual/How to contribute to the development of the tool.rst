=======================================================

All the community is encouraged to collaborate to the maintenance and development of OSeMOSYS by proposing code modifications, enhancements and extensions. The proposers may want to have the modifications reviewed by experts and included in a bi-annual peer-reviewed publication on the status of development of OSeMOSYS. In such case, they shall submit them following the instructions below: 

-	Sign in or sign up to GitHub and create a pull request on the OSeMOSYS GitHub page.

-	Upload a folder named in the following format: ‘Title of the modification/extension_Name Surname of the developer_Institution’. The folder must contain the following material:

	* A .txt file containing the modified version of the OSeMOSYS code;
	
	* A .txt file containing the original version of OSeMOSYS which the modification branched from;
	
	* A .doc file briefly presenting 1) a conceptual description, 2) the algebraic formulation and 3) the code formulation of each modification;
	
	* A test case-study used by the developer to test the correct functioning of the modification;
	
	* The .txt results file of the test case-study.
	
If the proposers are not interested in having the modifications reviewed by experts and included in the bi-annual peer-reviewed publication, the may upload them in dedicated folders within the Pool for ideas on the OSeMOSYS GitHub. In this folder, the proposers are free to enclose the documentation in the form they deem most appropriate. The folder is publicly accessible, but no review is granted for the material in it.
